# services/__init__.py
# This file can be empty.
# It makes 'services' a Python package.

# Optionally, you could do:
# from . import category_service
# from . import product_service
# from . import location_service
# from . import inventory_service
# from . import sales_service
# from . import stock_count_service
# But it's often cleaner to let modules import services they need directly
# using absolute paths like 'from services import product_service'.
